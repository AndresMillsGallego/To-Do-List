I decided to take on this project as it is one that I found interesting and one that I thought I would personally use.  I started to make this app between labs while in the Code 201 course.  After we finished the portion on local storage I wanted something to practice what I had learned and in the process help me retain the information.  

I built this app with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  I am most proud of the design and layout of the app.  It turns out I was correct in my assumption and I actually use this every day!  

It still is only able to rely on `localStorage`, but I plan on refactoring the code for this app as I gain knowledge and experience.  

The next stretch goal I want to attempt is coding the app so that multiple lists can be created, stored and loaded.  

All the code for this project can be found on my github
